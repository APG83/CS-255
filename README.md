# CS 255 Module Eight Journal – DriverPass Project

## Project Summary
DriverPass is a system designed for a client named **DriverPass**, a company that wants to help students prepare for their driving tests. The client requested an online system that allows students to take practice tests, schedule driving lessons with instructors, and track their progress. The system needed both **student and administrative access**, including scheduling, user management, and secure login features.

## What I Did Well
I did particularly well in identifying and documenting the **functional and nonfunctional requirements** of the system. My business requirements document clearly outlined the goals, stakeholders, and success criteria, ensuring that the system design stayed aligned with the client’s needs. I also translated those requirements effectively into the system design document by using **UML diagrams** and describing the system architecture clearly.

## What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part, I would improve the **data flow and database design** sections. I could include more detailed **entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs)** to show how user, instructor, and schedule data interact. This would make the design more precise and implementation-ready.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted user needs by focusing on the client’s main goal: to create a convenient, reliable, and secure way for students to access driving education online. I included features like scheduling lessons, taking practice tests, and generating progress reports. Considering user needs is vital because it ensures the final system actually solves the client’s problems and provides a good user experience.

## My Approach to System Design
When designing software, I start by **gathering and analyzing requirements** to understand what the client truly wants. I then create **use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams** to visualize the system’s structure and behavior. In the future, I plan to use more **iterative design methods**—such as prototyping and feedback loops—to refine the design continuously and ensure alignment with user expectations.
